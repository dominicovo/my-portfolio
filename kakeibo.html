                    <p>People tend to have problems saving their finances, and as a result, they overspend even probably more than what they earn. How might we design a platform where people can easily save money by keeping a record of all their finances in one app.</p>

                    <p><b>What I did: </b> <br/>First, I decided to focus on direct and indirect competitors, apps that have same or almost the same features as related to finance management, apps like <b>Mint, Ynab and Goodbudget.</b></p>
