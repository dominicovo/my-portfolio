                                    <li><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> JPG Store is primarily web-based, which can limit accessibility for users who prefer mobile devices. An app provides a user-friendly and convenient interface, allowing individuals to engage with NFTs on the go, 
                                        from the palm of their hand, enabling broader participation in the NFT ecosystem.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><strong>User Experience:</strong> Navigating and interacting with NFT platforms can sometimes be overwhelming and complex, especially for newcomers. Having an app strives to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, simplifying the process of discovering, buying, selling, 
                                        and managing NFTs. By offering a streamlined interface and leveraging mobile-centric design principles, the app enhances the overall user experience and encourages broader adoption.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><strong> Portfolio Management and Tracking:</strong> Managing and tracking NFT portfolios can be challenging, especially as the number of NFT holdings grows. The app provides tools for users to effectively organize, track, and monitor their NFT collections, 
                                        including ownership history, value tracking, and portfolio management features. This is solved through getting push notification on a regular bases.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong> Community Engagement:</strong> Engaging with other NFT enthusiasts, artists, and collectors is an essential aspect of the NFT experience. JPG mobile app incorporates social features and community engagement functionalities, allowing users to share and collaborate within the app. 
                                            This solves the problem of isolation and fosters a sense of community, enabling users to connect, discover new artists, and engage in discussions.</p></li>

                                <p>For the Onboarding screens, I followed a simple minimalistic design to keep them clean and simple. Starting with some features info just to enlighten the users on what to expect in the app. 
                                    After which the users are being taken to the app profile page, this is so they can link their profile easily for more accessability, by following the process to connect their wallet by scanning the QR code provided to them on the website profile page.</p>

                                <p>For the homepage, I tried to make it as easy and fun for the user to get along when using the app, this is because, one of the major goals of the app is to view collections, so being able to see different kind of collections at once will be very helpful. 
                                    And so we have 'Spotlight Collection' 'Trending collections' 'Launchpad Collections' and 'Browse Categories'.</p>

                                <p>NFT statistics refer to the data and metrics associated with the performance, growth, and trends within the NFT market. These statistics provide insights into various aspects of the NFT ecosystem, including sales volume, average prices, floor price, and artist adoption.
                                    I broke the stats down into 24 hours, 7 days, 30 day and all time, this way the users can get to see statistics in different periods. They can also search for a given collection stat from this page.</p>

                                <p>Getting to see users positive review also helped give me a sense of fulfilment and some other user needs.
                                     Also I think It's important to actively listen to user feedback, address concerns, and continuously improve the platform based on user needs and preferences. This iterative approach can lead to a better user experience and a more thriving NFT marketplace ecosystem.</p>
